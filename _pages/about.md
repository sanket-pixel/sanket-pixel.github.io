I am Sanket Shah, a passionate perception engineer based in Berlin, Germany. With a strong drive for innovation and a deep-rooted enthusiasm for GPU acceleration in AI, particularly in edge devices such as NVIDIA Orin, I am dedicated to pushing the boundaries of autonomous driving technology.

Having completed my bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Mumbai University and a master's degree in Computer Science with a specialization in Computer Vision and Robotics from the University of Bonn, Germany, I have developed a solid foundation in cutting-edge technologies.

Currently, I contribute my expertise to MotorAI GmbH, an autonomous driving company at the forefront of the industry. In my role, I focus on the exciting realms of Monocular 3D Detection, Lidar-Camera-Radar Sensor Fusion-based 3D Detection, and Quantization. By harnessing the power of machine learning models and advanced techniques, I am actively involved in bridging the gap between research and production, ensuring that our autonomous vehicles operate seamlessly in real-world scenarios.

Throughout my journey, I have cultivated proficiency in an array of programming languages and frameworks, including C++, Python, and CUDA. Leveraging my knowledge in NVIDIA's TensorRT, CUDA programming, and Driveworks (in Orin), I efficiently optimize machine learning models for deployment on edge devices, enabling robust and efficient AI-driven solutions.

This platform serves as a curated collection of my work, where I showcase my contributions in deep learning, robotics, and computer vision. Join me as we delve into the exciting realm of GPU-accelerated AI, unraveling the potential of edge devices in revolutionizing autonomous driving technology.

Feel free to explore my repositories, where you will find projects highlighting my expertise in GPU acceleration, monocular 3D detection, sensor fusion-based 3D detection, and more. I welcome inquiries and collaboration opportunities, so don't hesitate to reach out.
