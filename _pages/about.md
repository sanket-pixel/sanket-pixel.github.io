I’m Sanket Shah, a passionate perception engineer based in Erfurt, Germany, driven by a deep-rooted enthusiasm for GPU acceleration in AI, particularly in edge devices like NVIDIA Orin. I specialize in High-Performance Computing (HPC) for robotics and computer vision, dedicated to pushing the boundaries of autonomous driving technology.

Having completed my bachelor’s in Computer Engineering from Mumbai University and a master’s in Computer Science with a specialization in Computer Vision and Robotics from the University of Bonn, I’ve built a strong foundation in cutting-edge technologies. Currently, I contribute my expertise to Spleenlab GmbH, where I focus on GNSS-denied localization, sensor fusion, and efficient inference libraries for edge devices such as NVIDIA Jetson and Snapdragon platforms.

By harnessing the power of machine learning models and advanced HPC techniques, I actively bridge the gap between research and real-world deployment, ensuring that AI models are faster, lighter, and more reliable. This platform serves as a curated collection of my work in GPU acceleration, 3D object detection, and robotics. Feel free to explore my projects, reach out for collaborations, or connect to discuss the future of AI-driven systems.
