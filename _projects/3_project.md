This project is a high-performance C++ implementation of the **YOLO-World** model for real-time, open-vocabulary object detection. The entire inference pipeline is accelerated using **NVIDIA TensorRT** and **CUDA**, allowing the system to detect any object in an image based on a natural language text prompt.

The application bypasses Python dependencies for a pure C++ backend, making it suitable for production and edge deployment scenarios where speed and efficiency are critical.
